# MC6809P
This repo contains the on going work of building a simple *Basic 6809 CPU Single Board Computer*. I'm have a higher priority project that superceeds this one so things will go somewhat slowly.

* The first task was build a simple NVRam programmer--**done**.
* The next task is to test the 4 CPUs to make sure they *free run*.
* Once I know that I have a functioning CPU I can build a more feature capable programmer.
* Then I can build a simple breadboard test with minimal chips.
* **TODO** add more items. LOL

See individual folders for additional *readme*s on each sub section.
