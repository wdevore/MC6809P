# MC6809P SBC
This repo contains the on going work of building a simple *Basic 6809 CPU Single Board Computer*. I have a higher priority project that superceeds this one so things may go somewhat slowly.

I've broken things down into tasks:

* **done** - First is to build a simple NVRam programmer.
* Next is to test the CPUs to make sure they *free-run*.
* Once I know that I have a functioning CPU I can build a more feature capable programmer.
* Then I can build a simple breadboard test with minimal chips.
* **TODO** add more items. LOL

See docs folder for additional *readme*s on each sub section.

## Inprogress:

* Working on building a Perf board and Ziff socket to plug into a Mega 2560 microcontroller.
* Create a kicad schematic of Mega with just the pins used.
* Create a kicad schematic of TinyFPGA.
